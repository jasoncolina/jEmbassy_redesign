Re-Design project of the Embassy of Japan in Canada [WIP]

Heya, this is just a personal project I started with the intent on trying to modernize the website for the Japanese Embassy in Canada.
I got motivated to do this to practice my web development skills, but to also help clean up the embassy's website. It's kinda dated right now so I just wanna help em out (silently and ninja-like). If you wanna help out, teach me a thing or two or if anything comes up, just reach out!
